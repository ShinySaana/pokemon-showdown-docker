# This is an example file containing the necessary configuration values
# for running a Pokemon Showdown stack through this project.
# Please copy this file to the same directory as `config.yml` and fill
# in the values as needed.
# TODO: allow configurable config.yaml path

# The values defined here should let `psim-dc` generate all
# the necessary config files for each individual Pokemon Showdown project.
# The produced files do not aim to be comprehensive; rather, they
# are meant to be "enough" for a self-sustaining PS stack.
# Configurtation entries such as custom colors, the list of Showdown servers,
# or custom ads will not be configured here.

# The end result will be templated from the environment variables of the
# calling process. Feel free to take advantage of that.
# Furthermore, root keys starting in `x-` will never be used by this project.
# Feel free to use those as well.

# The login server, and other services, need a pair of 
# assymetric cryptographic keys to function, and to function securely.
# They can be generated with `psim-dc <> generate-key`.

# They will be loaded by the config generator. Do not put the keys themselves here!
# By default, `services/config` is mounted to `/config`.
# `psim-dc <> generate-key` will generate them in the correct location.

# If generating keys with `psim-dc <> generate-key`, keep `key_algorithm` as is.
# Otherwise, refer to this documentation for more information:
# https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptocreateverifyalgorithm-options

# And most of all: keep the private key private! Do not commit it or disclose it, ever!
